Seif e:
We can see that for settings 1,3 the best bit assignment computed can be obtained by taking the bit that maximize the posterior probability P(Xi = b| XA) for each internal node.
For setting 2 that is not entirely the case.
We can see from these results:

P(X1) = [0.004972500000000001, 0.004900500000000001]. (Normalized: [0.5036463081130355, 0.49635369188696443])
Max(P(X1)) = 1. P(X1=1) = 0.0036741600000000014
that they do not match. The bit that would maximize posterior probability for X1 is 0 but we see that when computed with the most probable assignment algorithm we get bit=1.
The difference is that the second method takes in account every node for computing the best assignment given the observed values, as the first method is only the most probable assignment for this specific node given the observed values.
In other words, the first method is less general does not answer the question "What is the best assignment of the network given the observed values?" but "What is the best assignment for this specific node, given the observed values?"
